This is the codebase for my personal blog, where I'll discuss almost anything that my knowledge allows.

## Technology Used

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) mixed in just for me to practice my typing skills.

I also chose [`.mdx`](https://mdxjs.com/) as the blog post format because it makes it easier for me to exercise my creativity when explaining different concepts.

The blog is currently deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) because they made it more convenient (and cheaper).

## Topics

The following are the topics which I study constantly and pretend to address on my blog â€” each in their own subdomains:

- Economy
- Psychology

- Mathematics
